#How to install DeepMedic on Ubuntu?

Before starting the installation you will need to check if you have cuda and the graphics card drivers already setup on your machine. You can do this using these commands:

```bash
#get cuda version
nvcc --version
#Check GPU info
nvidia-smi
#find the path to cuda
whereis -b cuda
```

If you get an output that looks like this, great you have [cuda](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) installed on your machine and you can continue this tutorial, otherwise you can find [here](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere-Bitfusion/3.0/Example-Guide/GUID-ABB4A0B1-F26E-422E-85C5-BA9F2454363A.html) the method to install cuda.
```[mohamedmakhlouf@fedora nnUNet]$ nvcc --version
nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver
Copyright (c) 2005-2021 NVIDIA Corporation
Built on Wed_Jun__2_19:15:15_PDT_2021
Cuda compilation tools, release 11.4, V11.4.48
Build cuda_11.4.r11.4/compiler.30033411_0
```

Another package required by the program and that we must check before starting the installation is [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=fr) do this you must use the command below, if it displays a version higher than 2.0 it's good you have TF installed. 
```bash
#check Tf installed version
python3 -c 'import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)'

#Expected output style => 2.0
2.6.0
```
if not I invite you to Download it from [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install?hl=fr) by choosing the right version compatible with your GPU. 
```bash
#example of command for Linux
pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.0
```

From now on you will open a terminal where you want to install the framework and download the software with these commands
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kamnitsask/deepmedic/
```


Then you have to configure a virtual environment for python using conda which will collect all the packages required by the framework using these commands.
```bash
#Dont forget to replace FOLDER_FOR_ENVS by the Folder of your environement if u have one or u can use this command to create one
mkdir FOLDER_FOR_ENVS  #IF YOU WANT TO USE THE SAME FOLDER NAME 
conda create -p FOLDER_FOR_ENVS/ve_tf_dmtf python=3.6.5 -y
source activate FOLDER_FOR_ENVS/ve_tf_dmtf
```
Once you have setup and activated your conda virtual environment correctly you will see that your prompt has changed, now you have to go to the root of the deepMedic project that you cloned a little before to install all the dependencies with these commands:

```bash
$ cd DEEPMEDIC_ROOT_FOLDER
$ pip install .

```

To be able to use the model with 3D CNN architecture you need to ensure that TensorFlow is  able to find CUDAâ€™s compiler, you can do this quickly following these instructions:

```bash
#check if this variables exist already in the environment
echo $CUDA_HOME
echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
echo $PATH
#if you have 3 lines with paths to cuda and cuda's libraries you have nothing to do
#else 
#If you want a solution to do it once you have to adapt and add the last three lines here  to your  .bachrc file using this commands
cd 
sudo nano .bashrc

#Or you can just tape this 3 commands before using DeepMedic in the same terminal that you would use after to manipulate nnUnet. 
#This is a temporory solution if you do not have  access to root
$ export CUDA_HOME=/path/to/cuda                   # If using cshell instead of bash: setenv CUDA_HOME /path/to/cuda
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/cuda/lib64
$ export PATH=/path/to/cuda/bin:$PATH

```
#PS: to get the path of cuda check the top of this document

And finally to get acceleration and have fast segmentation you have to check if cuDNN is installed with this command, if you don't get the same output you can easily install it with these commands:
```bash
#To check if cuDNN is already installed (REPLACE PATH/TO/CUDA)
cat /path/to/cuda/include/cudnn_version.h | grep CUDNN_MAJOR -A 2
#if you have something like this as output  you havec cuDNN installed before
$ cat /usr/local/cuda-11.4/include/cudnn_version.h | grep CUDNN_MAJOR -A 2
#define CUDNN_MAJOR 8
#define CUDNN_MINOR 2
#define CUDNN_PATCHLEVEL 2
--
#define CUDNN_VERSION (CUDNN_MAJOR * 1000 + CUDNN_MINOR * 100 + CUDNN_PATCHLEVEL)

#endif /* CUDNN_VERSION_H */

#else download cudNN from here : https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn
#copy the cudnn.h file
sudo cp ./cuda/include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda/include
#Copy all files under cuda/lib64/to the/usr/local/cuda/lib64 folder and add read permissions:
sudo cp ./cuda/lib64/* /usr/local/cuda/lib64
sudo chmod a+r /usr/local/cuda/include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudnn*
#reboot your machine and check if cuDNN is already installed using command above
```

To test your installation you can run this command if you have an output that looks like this and nothing crash it means that you have succeeded in your installation.
```bash
#You have to be in the root of deepMedic and your virtual environment is activated
#run this command to check that the model is working on cpu correctly
./deepMedicRun -model ./examples/configFiles/tinyCnn/model/modelConfig.cfg \
               -train examples/configFiles/tinyCnn/train/trainConfigWithValidation.cfg
#it may takes a few minutes depending on your CPU capacities and the end of the output should appeared like this

               -train ./examples/configFiles/tinyCnn/train/trainConfigWithValidation.cfg \
               -dev cuda0
#if the output of this command looks like this, congratulations you did a great job !  you have a correct installation
