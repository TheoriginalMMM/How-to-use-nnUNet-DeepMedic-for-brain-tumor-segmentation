# How-to-use-nnUNet-DeepMedic-for-brain-tumor-segmentation
In this project you will find a tutorial on how to train or/and use a pre-trained model of two neural network models designed for medical imaging segmentation, especially brain tumor segmentation: deepMedic and nnUnet.  With the help of this project you will be able to install one of these two frameworks in a linux operating system and use them to segment brain tumors.

You will find in this project two tutorials in two .md files each dedicated to a specific model/framwork:

-[nnU-Net](nnU-Net.md)

-[DeepMedic](DeepMedic.md)

This project has been developed for the Marc Jeannerod Institute of Cognitive Sciences (ISC-MJ) and will be useful for internal research projects of this last.
